# R-code-Neural-Network-based-Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain-
1. This R code is the implementation of Neural Network based Monte Carlo Markov Chain 
2. This code requires R packages: MASS and Amore. 
3. The models implemented in this code is DINA model, a latent classificaiton model that are widely discussed in educational measurement and testing.
4. The paper about this method is publised in Journal of Classification:     http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00357-013-9134-7
